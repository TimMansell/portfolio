This is the source code for my personal portfolio site.

My website uses npm, gulp, and bower.  Ensure you have those packages installed first.

##Instructions:

*npm install*

To load my site in development mode, run: 

*gulp serve:dev*

To load my site in production mode, run: 

*gulp serve*

**Note**: if repo has just been cloned, 'gulp build' needs to be run before this step.

To load my site in production mode using a clean repackaging of assets, run: 

*gulp serve:build*
